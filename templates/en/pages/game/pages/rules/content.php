Going for a boss is considered a group action and you must always have your Union Party open so everyone can join.

You can only close or kick joining members if the boss HP is below 30%.</span><br/>

Admins will not take responsibility in any of this cases, but will try to help you recovering your account. But, as with the scamming rule, no items will be returned.</span></span><br/>
				<span style="color:#FFFFFF"><strong>3. Investigating and access to accounts</strong></span><br/>
				<span style="color:#cccccc"><span style="font-family:arimo; font-size:13px">If any account is suspected in anyway, admins have the right to log it without previous notification to the owner.
